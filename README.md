Full Stack Web Development with modern Javascript by University of Helsinki. 

Focused solely on single web page application (SPA aka no reference). Executed with React that is RESTful on GraphQL implemented with Node.js. Part 4 and 5 includes extensive testing while the rest reiterates debugging applications, multi configrations for different modes and OS to managing different runtime environment with noSQL databases aka MongoDB.

Below is my certificate of completion and exercises to the 2022 extension of the course.
